#+TITLE: Boot strategy
- this is where boot process strategy programs get maintained

* Options
- note: the user can opt for defining his own git url to assert from where he wants to grab his dependencies.
- that's useful, for example, if you mantain your own private gitlab server or cgit.
- you just have to create a file that populates a zsh associative array:
  1. create a file called =~/.options/shell-options.zsh=
  2. populate the file like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
urlhash[awesome/dependency]=https://mycustom.gitlab.server.com/awesome/dendency.git
urlhash[foo/bar]=https://foo.com/cgit/baz.git
#+END_SRC

- done.
